The bi-weekly Link Stash, with some Links I found over the week. (This time a little late, was on vacation)

* [Numi](http://numi.io/ 'Beautiful calculator app for Mac')   
Looks nice, really like the simple interface
* [chrony â€“ Home](http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/ 'chrony is a versatile implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP). It can synchronize the system clock with NTP servers, reference clocks (e.g. GPS receiver), and manual input using wristwatch and keyboard. It can also operate as an NTPv4 (RFC 5905) server and peer to provide a time service to other computers in the network.')   
Was testing alpine linux and think this is a cool NTP client
* [WordSafety.com](http://wordsafety.com/ 'Check a name for unwanted meanings in foreign languages')   
Some people should use this before releasing a software with some hipster name ;)
* [Arranged for Mac](http://www.arrangedapp.com/ 'Create any arrangement of web content you'd like, and save it for later.')   
This works quite nice, nagios and jira in the same browser window :)
* [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/ 'A productive web framework that does not compromise speed and maintainability')   
Was really looking into Elixir and that could be the Rails for it. Promising.
* [mdless](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/ 'I often use iTerm2 in visor mode, so is annoying. I still wanted a way to view Markdown files quickly and without cruft.')   
I use Markdown for all my files, and it really helps to have a quick look in the terminal.
* [Artificial Intelligence for robots and swarms](https://opentechschool-brussels.github.io/AI-for-robots-and-swarms/ 'Let's build little brains.')   
Was attending this workshop on the otsconf, and really like it.
* [Vysor](http://www.vysor.io/ 'A window to your Android')   
This is really nice, using your Chrome to view your Android Smartphone

All of my links can be found on [my Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:sangyye/t:link-stash/ 'Sangyyes Pinboard: Link Stash' )
