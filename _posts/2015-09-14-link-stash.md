The bi-weekly Link Stash, with some Links I found over the week.

* [htty, the HTTP TTY by htty](https://htty.github.io/htty/)   
Something nice to see how the web works and to test your rest api
* [Commit Message Generator](http://whatthecommit.com/)   
If you need some commit message, use it with `git commit -m "$(curl -s http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt )"`
* [sslip.io: A Valid SSL Certificate for Every IP Address](http://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/sslip-io-a-valid-ssl-certificate-for-every-ip-address)   
Looks nice to test your ssl deployment in dev. But use it on your own server.
* [Raspberry Pi 7&quot; Touchscreen Display - Raspberry Pi Swag](http://swag.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-7-inch-touchscreen-display 'The 7” Touchscreen Monitor for Raspberry Pi gives users the ability to create all-in-one, integrated projects such as tablets, infotainment systems and embedded')   
I really need this to build my own little status monitor.
* [Crystal — Murphy Apps](http://murphyapps.co/crystal 'A portfolio of iPhone & iPad applications I have created. Including Crystal  - An ad blocker for iOS 9.')   
So with iOS 9 adblocking is finally coming on iDevices.
* [Endless Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/ 'Endless Sky : A space exploration and combat game similar to Escape Velocity')   
Looks like a game for some nice weekends.
* [Lumail - Console Mail Client with Lua scripting](http://lumail.org/ 'lumail console mail client.')   
Lua is a really nice language to script your mail.
* [httpbin(1): HTTP Client Testing Service](https://httpbin.org/)   
I use it to test some of my web scripts.
* [Back out all the things! Oh wait..](https://blog.crashed.org/dont-backout/ 'It's one of those things that everybody knows. When something breaks, you revert recent changes (or bisect) until it works. You keep going until you solve the problem. The identified code is removed from upstream and everyone moves on. That's the way it works, right? via Pocket')   
Interesting read.
* [The Website that got Me Expelled](http://www.codeword.xyz/2015/09/05/the-website-that-got-me-expelled/ 'I was in grade eleven, and it was already late in the school year when I returned to the principal’s office after my five day suspension. via Pocket')
* [BashPitfalls - Greg&apos;s Wiki](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls 'This page shows common errors that Bash programmers make. These examples are all flawed in some way.')   
Really good read, everyone with some bash scripts should read this.
* [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/index.html 'This is the in-progress free version of Learn C the Hard Way.')   
You want to learn C? Start here.
* [Activities - Computer Science Unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/activities/ 'Each Unplugged activity is available to download in PDF format, with full instructions and worksheets. Background sections explain the significance of each activity to computer science, and answers are provided for all problems. All you need for most of these activities are curiosity and enthusiasm. There are photos and videos showing some of the activities in action, and we’ve collected links to other useful resources. The activities are primarily aimed at the five to twelve year-old age group,...')   
Nice Ressource to learn Computer Science without the need to have a computer.
