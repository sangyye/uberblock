The weekly Link Stash, with some Links I found over the week. I forgot last week, so this week some more :D

* [Lychee — Self-hosted photo-management done right](http://lychee.electerious.com/ 'Lychee is a free photo-management tool, which runs on your server or web-space. Installing is a matter of seconds. Upload, manage and share photos like from a native application. Lychee comes with everything you need and all your photos are stored securely.')   
  Some nice Photo gallery made with PHP
* [UNIX Server CHMOD Calculator](http://www.csgnetwork.com/csgchmodcalc.html 'This utility is used to calculate permissions for files used on UNIX servers.')   
  Nice website, I sometimes forgot how to calculate them.
* [Send Me Cat Facts](https://www.sendmecatfacts.com/ 'Cat Facts :D')   
  Cat facts for you or your friends/enemies/everybody
* [Gorilla, the golang web toolkit](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/ 'Gorilla is a web toolkit for the Go programming language')   
  Want so build a webapp for work, seems like a good toolkit in go
* [boycott docker](http://www.boycottdocker.org/)   
  Some interesting points here, from my standpoint you should use BSD jails until they fix it.
* [xhyve – Lightweight Virtualization on OS X Based on bhyve](http://www.pagetable.com/?p=831)   
  Looks interesting, time to test something :D
* [Paw – The ultimate REST client for Mac](https://luckymarmot.com/paw 'We build the most delightful tools to make interaction with REST services seamless and let you focus on developing the apps you dream about.')   
  Something I would like to have last month, maybe useful in the future
* [motd.sh - dynamic message of the day generator](http://motd.sh/ 'dynamic message of the day (~/.motd) generator for Mac and Linux')   
  Interesting, but i don't like how it's installed
* [Hacker&apos;s guide to Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/ 'Musings of a Computer Scientist.')
* [Magic the Gathering card data in JSON format](http://mtgjson.com/ 'This project provides up to date Magic the Gathering card data in JSON format for developers to easily use in their projects.')   
  Really like that trading card game, hopefully can use that in a future project
