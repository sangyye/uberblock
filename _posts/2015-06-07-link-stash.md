The weekly Link Stash, with some Links I found over the week.

* [TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)   
  Some Interesting small database with no dependencies except python
* [Free Mumble Server Hosting](http://guildbit.com/)   
  Nice idea if you need a fast mumble server for an interview or a raid
* [&apos;Re: Blob-free OpenBSD kernel needed&apos; - MARC](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=143355112811564&w=2)   
* [benjaminoakes/maid · GitHub](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid)   
  Nice tool to clean my Download folder on a regular base
* [Hugo :: A fast and modern static website engine](http://gohugo.io/)   
  Seems like a cool jekyll clone written in go
* [Chris Ball » Announcing GitTorrent: A Decentralized GitHub](http://blog.printf.net/articles/2015/05/29/announcing-gittorrent-a-decentralized-github/)   
  I also think we need something to make this single point of failure gone
* [BBC Radio 4 Extra - Franz Kafka - Metamorphosis, Episode 1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007jwnt#auto)   
  Benedict Cumberbatch reads Franz Kafka
* [Online regex tester and debugger: JavaScript, Python, PHP, and PCRE](https://regex101.com/)   
  Really nice since I have to build some regex at work
* [Don&apos;t use Hadoop - your data isn&apos;t that big - Chris Stucchio](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html)   
  2GB are not big data!
* [Git in six hundred words](http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words)  
  Short and useful
