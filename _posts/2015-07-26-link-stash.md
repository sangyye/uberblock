Sorry for the long pause, I think I will make the Link Stash biweekly in future. Less Time, and not so many links to share. Maybe this will change, or maybe not. ;)

* [Packer by HashiCorp](https://packer.io/ 'Packer is a tool for creating machine and container images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.')   
Will be nice with ansible I think
* [Bosun](http://bosun.org/ 'is an open-source, MIT licensed, monitoring and alerting system by Stack Exchange. It has an expressive domain specific language for evaluating alerts and creating detailed notifications. It also lets you test your alerts against history for a faster development experience.')   
Looks interesting
