The weekly Link Stash, with some Links I found over the week (with one day delay, so I'm good ;) ).

* [Oh, shit, git!](http://ohshitgit.com/ 'Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about in order to fix your problem.')   
Nice little site to fix problems if you commit something wrong.
* [doas mastery](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/doas-mastery 'Doas Mastery for OpenBSD')   
Little Mastery guide to doas, the sudo alternative from openbsd
* [PiBakery - The blocks based, easy to use setup tool for Raspberry Pi](http://www.pibakery.org/index.html 'The easiest way to setup a Raspberry Pi')   
Build your own RaspberryPi image with a neat gui tool
* [searx](https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/ 'Search without being tracked.  Searx is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from more than 70 search services. Users are neither tracked nor profiled. Additionally, searx can be used over Tor for online anonymity.')   
Want your own google? Now you can.
* [darkstat](https://unix4lyfe.org/darkstat/ 'Captures network traffic, calculates statistics about usage, and serves reports over HTTP.')   
Collect some nice stats from your network traffic
* [rclone - rsync for cloud storage](http://rclone.org/ 'Rclone is a command line program to sync files and directories to and from the cloud')

All of my links can be found on [my Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:sangyye/t:link-stash/ 'Sangyyes Pinboard: Link Stash' )
