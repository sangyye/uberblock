The weekly Link Stash, with some Links I found over the week. Sorry for the delay, ruby is killing me. So I will try to write some tool kit in Rust to help my getting my link-stash done.

* [nojhan/liquidprompt: A full-featured &amp; carefully designed adaptive prompt for Bash &amp; Zsh](https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt 'A full-featured & carefully designed adaptive prompt for Bash & Zsh')   
Awesome little enviroment to make your prompt look nice.
* [Overview Â· Rusoto](http://rusoto.org/ 'Rusoto is an AWS SDK written in Rust.')   
Looks nice to build some tools to interact with AWS.
* [fcambus/motyl: Opinionated static site generator written in Lua](https://github.com/fcambus/motyl 'Motyl is an opinionated static site generator written in Lua. It uses Mustache as templating system, and all content is written in Markdown.')   
I like static site generators
* [Etcher by resin.io](https://www.etcher.io/ 'Burn images to SD cards & USB drives, safe & easy.')   
I have to write SD-Cards quite often, so will try it.
* [SHENZHEN I/O](http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/ 'SHENZHEN IO: BUILD CIRCUITS. WRITE CODE. RTFM.')   
A game tipp, it's fun and kills to much time ;)
* [Home - Minetest](http://www.minetest.net/ 'A free, open source voxel game engine and game. Fully extendable. You are in control.')   
Game engine, nice.
* [OneDrive, for Linux](https://skilion.github.io/onedrive/)
* [Fossil: Home](https://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki 'Fossil is a simple, high-reliability, distributed software configuration management system')   
If you need a alternative to git, this seems quite nice.
* [dnsdist](http://dnsdist.org/ 'dnsdist is a highly DNS-, DoS- and abuse-aware loadbalancer. Its goal in life is to route traffic to the best server, delivering top performance to legitimate users while shunting or blocking abusive traffic.')   
Using it at work, where it does a good job on distribute all the DNS traffic. I really like it.
* [Automatically generate a RESTful API service for your legacy database. No code required!](https://github.com/jeffknupp/sandman2 'Automatically generate a RESTful API service for your legacy database. No code required!')   
Will test it to make your legacy database useful again.
* [mailcow mailserver suite](http://www.mailcow.email/ 'An open source mailserver suite.')   
Somebody want to host his mail?
