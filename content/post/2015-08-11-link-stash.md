The bi-weekly Link Stash (with two days delay, because vacation), with some Links I found over the weeks.

* [Showgoers](http://showgoers.tv/ 'A chrome extension to watch Netflix remotely with your friends or loved-ones')   
Seems like a good way to watch Netflix, with my SO on the Phone.
* [Videos zeigen alle Änderungen die an Star Wars vorgenommen wurden](http://www.kotzendes-einhorn.de/blog/2015-07/videos-zeigen-alle-aenderungen-die-an-star-wars-vorgenommen-wurden/)   
German, some youtube videos that show good the difference between the orignale movies and the things that change in the rework.
* [ProduKey - Recover lost product key (CD-Key) of Windows/MS-Office/SQL Server](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html)   
Get your Windows 7 Key before upgrading to Windows 10.
* [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/ 'Podcast player app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.')   
Instacast is no more, so I need something other.
* [sucks - systemd](http://suckless.org/sucks/systemd)   
Old, but I think it's interesting, also you can look at some commit messages
* [minutes.io — the best meeting tool since pen &amp; paper*](https://minutes.io/welcome 'Take notes & share them right away. No sign up. Just essence.')   
Really helpful in meetings.
* [BFG Repo-Cleaner by rtyley](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/ 'Removes large or troublesome blobs like git-filter-branch does, but faster. And written in Scala')   
I need to remove some files out of a git repo, works like promised ;)
* [Encryptr - Powered by Crypton](https://encryptr.org/ 'A free, open source password manager and e-wallet. Zero-knowledge. Cloud-based. Private.')   
looks interesting
* [Makefile Tutorial by Example](http://makefiletutorial.com/)   
Some good documentation about Make
