This time a little bit late, sorry for that. Try to get the bi-weekly again.

* [stormssh](https://github.com/emre/storm/ 'storm is a command line tool to manage your ssh connections.')  
A little cli to manage your ssh connections.
* [toybox](http://landley.net/toybox/ 'Toybox combines common Linux command line utilities together into a single BSD-licensed executable that's simple, small, fast, reasonably standards-compliant, and powerful enough to turn Android into a development environment.')  
A small busybox alternativ under the BSD-license
* [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/ 'Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program')  
Little program to manipulate packets on the net.
* [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/ 'An open-source service monitoring system and time series database.')  
Looks like a interesting program for monitoring.
* [Bee](http://www.neat.io/bee/ 'Native issue tracking that is simple and fast on your Mac')  
Would like to use it, but our company jira is too old. Sadly.
* [Mosh: the mobile shell](https://mosh.mit.edu/ 'Mobile shell that supports roaming and intelligent local echo. Like SSH secure shell, but allows mobility and more responsive and robust.')  
It's quite cool to use and make ssh more fun to use.
* [xkcd: Git](http://xkcd.com/1597/)  
It's so true, you may already see it.
* [Testinfra](https://testinfra.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ 'With Testinfra you can write unit tests in Python to test actual state of your servers configured by managements tools like Salt, Ansible, Puppet, Chef and so on.  Testinfra aims to be a Serverspec equivalent in python and is written as a plugin to the powerful Pytest test engine')  
Looks like a good way to test my ansible deployment.
* [cortesi/devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd 'A http daemon for local development')  
Fun thing to test some http things locally.
* [Dokku](http://progrium.viewdocs.io/dokku/ 'The smallest PaaS implementation you've ever seen Docker powered mini-Heroku in around 200 lines of Bash')   
Have installed it on my server, quite cool to use and fun. Works like promised. Really like it.
* [The Switch](http://makeit.netflix.com/the-switch)  
Will build it in the future, It looks like a thing you want to have.
* [sift - a fast and powerful open source alternative to grep](http://sift-tool.org/index.html 'A fast and powerful open source alternative to grep.')  
Not so fast like grep in my use case, but a nice user experience and deployment.
