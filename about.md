I like working with Computers, Operating Systems, Servers and building things. I studied in computer science at Hochschule Niederrhein, Universty of Applied Sciences in Germany.

When I'm not behind a computer (yes, this is possible, sometimes), I enjoy playing board games and mind puzzels. Also being outside and doing some hiking is an option.
